rabbit: Hello!
player: Hi! 
player: You're probably wondering,
player: who we are.
player: I am Rogue and this...
rabbit: Call me Bunny!
player: ...this is my best friend,
player: a very impatient Bunny.
player: We are in the harsh mountains 
player: of Paraguay.
player: I used to live in the city
player: and work as a programmer. 
player: Then, there was a sudden leap
player: in technology development.
player: People became rich and...mean to each other.
player: There was fraud. Crime.
player: I missed nature and minimalism
player: so much that I decided to leave the city.
player: And here I am, and...
rabbit: and I am here too!
rabbit: I have been following Rogue
rabbit: since the moment he entered the forest.
rabbit: He behaved so funny in the beginning!
rabbit: It's much better now. 
player: That's true! Bunny's intuition 
player: helps us find our way and warns us
player: if there are bandits nearby.
rabbit: ...and Rogue's strength
rabbit: helps us get rid of the bandits!
player: Let's go for a new adventure!
