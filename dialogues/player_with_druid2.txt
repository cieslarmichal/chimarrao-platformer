druid: Oh, good you're still here!
player: What happened?
druid: I wanted to warn you...
druid: There are many bandits nearby.
druid: Lately, they've formed a group.
player: Oh no...
player: Do you know the number?
druid: No, but I can share a trick with you.
druid: When you will meet them, press F!
druid: I can guarantee they will be surprised.
player: How can I repay you?
druid: Oh, just stop as many bandits as possible.
druid: They hurt others and they don't respect nature.
player: I promise I will!
druid: Goodbye!
